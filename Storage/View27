The girl asked the guy:
- What kind of music is playing?
The guy answers in surprise:
- Are you kidding? Don't you know that this is Stas Mikhailov?
Girl:
- I don't know and I don't want to know, turn off this shit or switch to football.
The next day, the guy proposed to the girl, and the girl went to listen to Stas Mikhailov to her mother...
