The liver was anxiously awaiting the upcoming Friday.
The kidneys were also worried that they would have to work hard.
The throat was warming up.
My nose itched.
My stomach was getting ready.
The ass was worried that adventures would find her again.
My legs and tongue were getting ready to stumble.
My head was afraid of getting sick.
My heart was bleeding.
And only one Brain was happy that tomorrow was Friday.
