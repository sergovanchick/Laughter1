The guy turns to the girl:
- Let me pinch your chest.
The girl in response:
- Ham!
Guy:
- And if I give you a thousand?
The girl to him:
- Get out!
The guy is not far behind:
- Oh, five!
The girl is already angry:
- I told you, get out! You moron!
The guy still:
- Ten thousand! A dozen and once for a breast?
The girl suddenly agreed. They went into the entrance, she took off her bra, the guy lay down with his head on one breast, touches the other with his hands, and the girl asks:
- Are you going to pinch it?
To which the guy responds:
- I don't have any money. And since I'm an honest man, I won't pinch my chest either!
