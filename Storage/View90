After military service, the guy returned to his native village. All the residents have surrounded him and are asking various questions, they say, how is it in the army. The soldier says:
- Complete moronism.
The residents were surprised by the answer. The guy says:
- Tomorrow I'll show you how it is in the army...
at four o'clock in the morning the bell rings for the whole village, the villagers have come running. They are sleepy, not happy. Not a fire, not another kind of accident. A guy comes out who came from the army and announces:
- So that's it! Now my dad and I are going fishing, the rest of us... Disperse!
