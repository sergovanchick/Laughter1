On the road, traffic police officers stop the car, examined the trunk, and there are many large daggers. The inspector asks:
- Why do you need so many bladed weapons?
The driver responds:
- I work as a juggler in a circus, juggling knives.
Inspector:
- I can't believe it, but show me. The driver, on the side of the road, starts juggling knives. In a passing car, the husband says to his wife:
- It's good that I stopped drinking, look how difficult the tests are now!
