Friends share how they spent the evening with men. First:
- It was terrible! Imagine, he took me to his house, immediately went to bed, finished after 5 minutes and fell asleep. A nightmare!
The second:
- And everything was like in a dream! We went to a restaurant and drank delicious wine. We went to him, two hours of foreplay, an hour of sex itself, and then we talked about everything for another hour! A fairy tale!
At the same time, two men meet on the other side of the city. The first one:
- It was a great evening! They immediately went to my place, the brains did not soar, slept together, I fell asleep, slept well, the mood is great!
The second:
- And I have some kind of n%zdets. I had to take her to a restaurant, where the waiter brought the most expensive wine. It was inconvenient, I had to take it. We came home, I didn't get up for two hours, couldn't finish for an hour, then couldn't sleep for an hour...
