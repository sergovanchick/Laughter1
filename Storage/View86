The sergeant conducts a briefing before landing on an island occupied by the enemy:
- Be wary of sharks and barracudas while crossing the coastal strip.
There are a lot of poisonous snakes on the shore, don't step on them.
Do not pick berries and fruits that grow in the area, get poisoned. Do not drink water from local wells, you may get a fever. Beware of predators and insects. Is everything clear? Any questions?
One private is interested in:
- Tell me, Sergeant sir, why do we need to win back such an island?
