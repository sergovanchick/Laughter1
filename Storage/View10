There are two people in the car, the driver and a very drunk passenger who is sitting in the back seat. The passenger listened a little and said:
"Shall I smoke?"
Driver:
- Yes, please.
The passenger lit a cigarette, he felt sick:
- It sucks for me, I'm going to puke...
Driver:
- Please puke!
The passenger threw up. He won 't calm down and says:
I want to piss, but my legs can't hold me, why don't I just sit here?
Driver:
- Of course, for God's sake!
The passenger took a piss, relaxed, lit a cigarette and turns back to the driver:
- What a great taxi you have, everything is possible. Smoking, pissing, puking...
Driver:
- I am not a taxi driver, but an employee of the Sober Driver service
