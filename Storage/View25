The woman tells the doctor:
- The impotence pills that you prescribed for my husband are so effective! I threw two things at him yesterday in the first course, so he threw me right at lunch, right on the table and wiped me off! Yes, and how!
The DOCTOR:
- Is it uncomfortable, perhaps?
Woman:
- Of course it's inconvenient, now at least don't show up at that cafe at all...
