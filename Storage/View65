At school, the teacher gives the children a task that they would fantasize if they crossed two animals of different species. Masha stretches out her hand:
- If you cross a cow and a pig, you will get fat milk and delicious meat.
Katya pulls out her hand:
- If you cross a rabbit with a chicken, the product will be fur and eggs.
Well, Vovochka pulls his hand. The teacher asks cautiously and Vovochka answers:
- If you cross pubic lice with fireflies...
the teacher interrupts Vovochka coughing:
- What are you saying?
Vovochka is talking:
- Imagine that. You come home alone, you're bored. Go to bed alone. No one warms you up, you're sad here too...
- You lift the blanket, and there's LAS VEGAS!
