Lenka yells:
- Mom, Vovka showed me the torch!
Mom comes into the room, grabs Vovka by the ear. Vovka refuses, it doesn't even seem to be his fault. I pulled Vovka by the ears and asked my daughter what exactly he showed. She spread all five fingers.
Mother:
- That's it? Lena, this is normal!
Lenka:
- Is it okay? Five facs, is it okay?
