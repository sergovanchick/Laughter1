The husband went on a business trip and a lover came to his wife. The wife threw a cape on the cage with a parrot, so that she wouldn't shake anything superfluous in front of her husband. We slept together a couple of times and the lover says:
- Tired of the monotony. How about I climb up on the closet, jump from it to the chandelier, swing on it, jump on the bed and enter you at full speed?
Wife:
- Wow! Let's!
The parrot can't stand it:
- It's better to pull out my tongue later, but I have to see it!
