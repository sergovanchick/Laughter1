A boy is playing in the sandbox. Suddenly, a man flies out of the window, from the 9th floor of the house opposite, and falls flat into the sandbox. The boy was stunned. The dust is such that the white light is not visible. The man jumped up abruptly, shook his head, hit his clothes a couple of times with his palm and said to the boy:
- That's it! The boy! Now uncles will fly out of the same window, and you count them. Understood?
The boy nodded in agreement, the man ran into the entrance and five minutes later from there, a man falls flat. The boy started:
- The first one!
The dust clears, a man stands up and says to the boy:
- Boy, wait, wait, don't count it yet, it's me again!
