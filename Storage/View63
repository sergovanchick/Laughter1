A Georgian is talking to his teenage son:
- Listen, Gotcha, where's the mauser that lies in my bedside table, right?
Son:
- I changed it for a watch.
My father tensed up:
- Genatsvale, how did you change it, to whom did you change it? And if a neighbor comes tomorrow and tells you, I had your dad, I had your mom, I had your sister, I had all your family! What are you going to tell him, huh?
- Half past eleven, eh!
