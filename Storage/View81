The stewardess comes with a tray of lollipops and offers:
- One at a time, please.
The guy takes two candies, and she gives him:
- Young man, one at a time.
Guy:
- And I took one for you!
Leaving, the stewardess blushed and replied:
- I don't suck at work!
The guy followed:
- And when can I come up?
