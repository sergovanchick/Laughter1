A southerner came to Vorkuta to visit a friend in military service. We haven't seen each other for many years, we had a good drink, I wanted to continue. Vorkutyanin says:
- And let's go to the sauna, have another drink, we'll call the girls.
The southerner says:
- Ah, let's go.
We arrived at the bathhouse, undressed. The southerner is all swarthy from sunburn, and the Vorkutyan is pale and not tanned. A Southerner and asks:
- Did you have a summer at all?
Vorkutyanin:
- Yes, it was, but I was working that day...
