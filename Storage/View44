A merchant comes to the priest and says:
- Father, we need to sing the cat's funeral!
Father:
- No, my son, it is not allowed.
Merchant:
- What about it?
Father:
- There is a commercial church across the street, they provide any services for money.
Merchant:
- Yes, there is not much money with you, only $ 4000
Father:
- So why didn't you say right away that your cat was baptized?
