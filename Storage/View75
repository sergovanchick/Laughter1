A man comes up to a little girl crying in the sandbox and asks:
- What are you doing? So big, but you're crying.
Girl wiping her tears:
- Uncle, go to the n%zdu!
The man was taken aback:
- How not beautiful! You're so small and you swear!
The girl told him:
- Uncle, you can x% figure it out, then I'm big, then I'm small...
