The guy came up to the counter in the office equipment store and said to the seller:
- Sell me two nurses.
The seller:
- I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Two of what? The nurses?
The guy points to the CD discs:
- Yes. Two please!
The seller corrects:
- This is a CD for digital recording on a computer drive. If you need something, ask by name.
The guy in revenge:
- Also sell me an optical quantum generator with a coherent radiation function with infrared glow.
The seller is surprised:
- What to sell?
Guy:
- Laser pointer, ept!
