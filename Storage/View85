A man comes home late at night. Drunk and rumpled. His wife meets him, all happy, smiling:
- Hello, my Superman. Where have you been, my Superman? Come on, I'll give you dinner, my Superman! Let's go to bed, my Superman.
My husband is fed up and he asks:
- And why did you start calling me Superman?
My wife's smile won't go away:
- Only cool supermen wear underpants over their trousers!
