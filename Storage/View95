A man is being interviewed for a position in the prosecutor's office. An employee of the HR department is interested in him:
- It says in your application form that you have physical disabilities. Can I go into a little more detail?
The man explains:
- You see, I was in the army in a hot spot, my balls were torn off.
HR officer to him:
- It's okay, in general, according to the data, you are suitable for us. You are accepted. Our working day is as usual, from 9:00 to 18:00, so come tomorrow at 11 o'clock sharp.
The man clarifies:
- I didn't quite understand. The working day starts at 9:00, why does it go out by 11 o'clock?
HR Officer:
- I'll explain. This is the prosecutor's office! For the first two hours, no one does anything, they wander around the building and scratch their eggs. You just won't have anything to do.
