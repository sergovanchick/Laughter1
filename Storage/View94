Two journalists who have been on business trips abroad for a long time meet. One complains to the other:
- It's getting harder and harder to work around the world, there's nothing but chaos! In Delhi, they stripped, on the Australian mainland, they swore, in Guadeloupe, they whipped! Yourself, what's up?
The second one is not fun:
- Don't ask! I just arrived from Adjara!
