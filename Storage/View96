In the Russian language lesson, the teacher gives a task:
- And so, children, come up with a sentence with the words PROBABLY BECAUSE.
Masha came up with an idea and pulls her hand:
- It will probably rain because there are clouds in the sky.
The teacher approvingly:
- Well done Masha. And now let's listen to Vovochka.
Vovochka says:
- Grandma is coming with a newspaper.
The teacher:
- While passing by...
Vovochka:
- She probably goes to the toilet because Grandma can't read.
