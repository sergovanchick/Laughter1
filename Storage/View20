A man walks into a bar, sits down with two beautiful girls and shouts at the bartender:
- Bartender, champagne for the girls.
The girls tell him:
- Man, you're trying in vain, we're lesbians.
Man:
- And how is that, excuse me?
Girls:
- We only like to have sex with women.
Man:
- Bartender, three glasses of champagne for us lesbians
