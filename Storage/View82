The Russian geologist decided to take the Chukchi hunting. He asks him before the campaign:
- Do you know how to shoot?
The Chukchi says:
- How Voroshilovskaya is a shooter, however!
Russian:
- Do you run fast?
The Chukchi responds:
- Masters of sports, however!
Russian:
Are you thinking fast? You mean savvy?
Chukchi:
- I graduated from the university, however!
We hurried on our way. They go another week, they came to a den, a bear sleeps in it. The Chukchi hit the bear on the forehead with the butt of his rifle. They have been running from the bear for three days, the geologist got tired, he raised his gun and shot the bear. The Chukchi looked at the lying bear and said to the Russian:
- You shoot well, however, but you don't think straight. If they ran into the village, they would have been shot there. And now to carry it on yourself, however!
