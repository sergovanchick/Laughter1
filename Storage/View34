A husband and his wife for the first time at a corporate party with colleagues. The wife is interested in:
"Who is that woman in the red dress?"
The husband says:
- This is the boss's mistress.
Wife:
"And that plump brunette over there?
":
- And this is the mistress of our chief accountant.
Wife:
- And the one in the blue polka dot dress?
Husband:
- This is the mistress of the head of our department.
Wife:
- And this skinny blonde?
The husband got carried away, got into courage and said:
- And this is my mistress!
The wife proudly says:
- Well, ours will be the best of all!
