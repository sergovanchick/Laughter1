Three hunters went hunting, two had vodka with them, and the third did not. And I want to drink, he tells the men:
- I'm willing to bet that blindfolded I can identify any game, its age and how it was killed! If I'm guessing, you'll give me a glass of vodka!
They blindfolded a third person and shoved a hare.
The third hunter touched it and immediately:
- It's a hare. He was 3 years old, died in a trap.
They added a glass to the third and shoved a boar. The third one touched it and says:
- A boar, aged 10, was killed from a rifled barrel with two shots to the neck.
This continued until the other two hunters ran out of vodka. The next day, the wives of the hunters meet. The wives of the first and second hunter in one voice:
- Ours left with vodka, but arrived sober.
The wife of the third hunter tells them:
- And mine left without vodka, arrived drunk in the trash, at night in a dream put his hand between my legs and mumbled ... Hedgehog, Daursky, 39 years old, chopped wound on his back.
