A man is being tried for poaching. The judge asks:
- How could you, hunting an ordinary sandpiper, shoot a very rare yellow-backed sandpiper?
The defendant, standing with his back to the courtroom, leans towards the judge and says in a low voice:
- Your Honor, I will answer, just tell me, is my wife looking at me now?
Judge:
- There are two dozen women in the hall, how do I know which one is yours?
The defendant:
- So I didn't know which of these damn sandpipers was yellow...
