A daughter who recently got married comes home and tells her mother:
- Mom, my husband and I don't get enough sleep at all, we don't go to bed before 3-4 o'clock at night.
Mother:
- Well, it's a young thing! Do you and your father hope that we will soon see the result of your efforts?
Daughter:
- Of course, Mom! I'm already at the 9th level in the fun farm, and my husband is at the 10th in the Word tanks!
