At a school for blind children, a math teacher asks a physical education teacher:
- Ivan Sergeich, how did you teach the kids to play football?
The physical education student responds:
- Nina Ivanovna, I put a bell inside the ball, now the children hear the ball and hit it. It's still very simple.
At this moment, a terrified grandmother runs into the teacher's room and screams:
- Are these your blind children playing football?
The physical education student says:
- These are ours, but what do you actually have against blind children?
Grandmother:
- Yes, I have nothing! Just a couple more minutes and they'll fucking kick my cow to death!
