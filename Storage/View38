The wolf and the fox caught the hare. The hare is hysterical and screaming:
- Don't eat me, please, I have four bunnies.
Lisa says,
"Calm down, we're just going to have a drink." Do you want a drink?
Hare:
- I want to.
Fox:
- Here's the money, run to the store for a bottle!
The hare took the money and ran away. The wolf says to the fox:
- Well, you're a strategist, red, the snack will also bring us a drink!
