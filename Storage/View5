A little girl spent two weeks preparing for the arrival of Santa Claus, learning a rhyme, sewing a dress. New Year's Eve, the doorbell rings. The girl runs to open the door herself, stumbles and falls. He gets up, opens the door, whimpering and wiping his snot. On the threshold stands a ruddy and slightly tipsy Santa Claus. Santa Claus in a joyful bass voice:
- Hello, girl, Happy New Year to you! Why are you crying, honey?
The girl says through her tears:
- I was waiting for you so much, grandpa was waiting so much, I was preparing, I was learning a rhyme, I was sewing a dress, now I ran to open the door, I fell, tore the dress and forgot the rhyme...
Santa Claus with sincere sadness, spreading his hands:
- Well, fuck your mother!
