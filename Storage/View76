Three merchants, an American, a Frenchman and a Russian are arguing about what happiness is.
American:
- Happiness, this is a ranch, a family and 300 buffaloes.
Frenchman:
- No, happiness, these are several mistresses, a villa in Nice, vineyards in Gascony.
Russian:
- Happiness is when you wake up in your three-story mansion, go out on the balcony and suddenly you see two minibuses with flashing lights flying through the gate. They jump out of one prosecutor's office, from another OBEP and ask:
- Man, is this a flower shop, house 8?
And you tell them:
- And x% is there, house 9!
