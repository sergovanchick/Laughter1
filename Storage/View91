The husband and wife bought a robot educator with a built-in polygraph, well, they decided to test it. The wife asks her husband:
- Did you drink yesterday?
The husband says:
- Not a gram!
The robot walked up to his father and slapped him hard. The father grimaced and changed the answer:
- Well, we had a couple of drinks at work.
Their son came from school, his father asks him:
- Where have you been?
The son answers:
- In extra classes at school.
The robot slapped his son on the back of the head.
Father:
- Stop lying! Tell the truth!
Son:
- My friends and I watched a porn tape.
The father gives his son another slap on the head:
- That's it! Don't ever cheat on your parents!
The wife, smiling, watches all this and says to her husband:
- Well, that's enough with him, he's your son after all!
And the robot strikes her in the jaw with lightning speed.
