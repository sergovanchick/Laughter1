Three business travelers settled in a hotel on the 45th floor. The receptionist warned them that the elevator was only open until midnight. In the evening, three friends went to a restaurant and were late by midnight. Well, let's go up the stairs. But in order to make it more fun, they divided the number of floors into three and everyone should tell scary stories on their floors. So we passed 15 floors under the bikes of the first, we reached the thirtieth floor under the bikes of the second. It was the turn of the third narrator and he began:
- And now, I'm going to tell you the scariest, most terrifying story, the scariest you'll ever hear and the scariest it can be...
- We fucking assholes forgot the key to our room at the reception desk to pick up from the receptionist.
