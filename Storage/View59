The old grandfather had a wife his age who was dying. He went through a lot of specialist doctors to somehow prolong the life of his betrothed, but no one could advise him anything useful. Old age is old age. And somehow I accidentally ended up with an alternative medicine specialist. He tells him:
- There is only one way to help your wife, and that is to have sex with her.
Grandfather hesitantly:
- Yes, I am very old already, Lenin himself was dying in my arms! Where does the strength come from?
Doctor:
- It's Up To you. This is the only option.
My grandfather gathered himself up as best he could and fulfilled his marital duty. He wakes up in the morning, but his old lady is not around. He got up and saw that his grandmother had come to life, was running around the house, cleaning, singing songs. The grandfather clasped his head in both hands and said:
- Stop beating, what a fool I am! I could have saved Lenin!
