An experienced boxer has a correspondent who is interested in:
- For example, you go into the entrance in the evening, and there a bully rushes at you. Your actions?
The boxer:
- A right hook to the head and he falls.
Reporter:
- And if there are two hooligans?
The boxer:
- The first one gets a right hook to the head, the first one falls. The second one from below hits the body and the second one falls.
Reporter:
- And if there are three hooligans?
The boxer:
- The first one gets a right hook in the head, the second one from below in the body.
Correspondent:
- And the third one?
The boxer:
- The third, the third... Oh, it's my birthday on the third.
