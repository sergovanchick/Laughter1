A boy came to the bar and said to the waiter:
- Give me 200 grams of vodka!
Waiter:
- Boy, are you fucked up? He's still young!
Boy:
- My father died.
Waiter:
- And how did it happen?
Boy:
- My father came home drunk, lit a cigarette and fell asleep with a cigarette. A fire broke out, firefighters were called, and dad jumped down from the 9th floor in fright.
Waiter:
- Crashed?
Boy:
- No, the firemen stretched the tent and it flew back home.
Waiter:
- Burned down?
Boy:
- No, he's down again.
Waiter:
- Crashed?
Boy:
- No, he fell on the awning again.
The waiter:
- Well, what happened, why did he die?
Boy:
- Yes, he fucked everyone, they shot him...
