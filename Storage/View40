An American economist tells a Russian colleague:
- We have an average salary of ten thousand dollars, eight thousand are needed for taxes, loans and living expenses. But where do the other two thousand go, it is unclear?
The Russian economist says:
- And our salary is also ten thousand, fourteen thousand are required for accommodation. And where the four thousand come from, who the hell knows!
