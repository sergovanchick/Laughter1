There is a cage with a parrot hanging on the street at the entrance to the pet store. A man walks by. Parrot him:
- Man!
Guy:
- What?
Parrot:
- Go to x%y!
The man was offended, went to the store director, snitched and the parrot was punished. The next day, passing by the cage, but already taught by yesterday's incident, he looks at the parrot in anticipation. He passed by in silence, already relaxed, but then the parrot:
- Man!
Guy:
What?
A parrot:
- Well, you understand me, right?
