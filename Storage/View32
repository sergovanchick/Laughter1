Trucker got a job at the traffic police. The commander sent him and a more experienced employee to the track with a radar.
In the evening, the commander asks:
- Well, how are you?
An experienced employee responds:
- I'm standing with the radar, and this one is sitting in the car and blinking with a high beam.
