The pirate entered the bar, the bartender asks him:
- I haven't seen you in a while. What seas have you been on? You don't look important!
The pirate says:
Yes, I'm all right.
Bartender:
- Why do you have a wooden leg, why is there a hook on one hand instead of a brush?
Pirate:
- The leg was torn off by a cannonball in battle, the hand was lost in a saber fight..
The bartender:
"Why do you have an eye patch?"
Pirate:
- One day we were walking on the sea, a flock of birds flew over us, I looked up and one of the birds pooped on my eye.
Bartender:
- Come on... Did you lose an eye because a bird pooped on it?
Pirate:
- Yes, it was just my first day with the hook!
