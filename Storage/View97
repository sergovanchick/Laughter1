A successful, well-off woman comes to the doctor and takes out:
- Doctor, I feel like I'm missing something.
The doctor examined her and says:
- Please tell us how your day is going.
The woman tells:
- Well, I wake up, drink a glass of water and sit down to breakfast. I eat a sandwich with salami, a sandwich with ham, a sandwich with salmon, a sandwich with black caviar.
- And since the sandwiches are small, I do not overeat, and therefore at 11 o'clock I sit down for tea with cakes, very, very small.
- I eat one eclair, one basket, a cake and potatoes.
- Accordingly, at one o'clock in the afternoon, I have lunch. I eat an olive pie, a herring, a vinaigrette, a salad with crabs, and only half a piece of soup!
The Doctor listened, listened:
- Stop, that's enough! You're missing a second anus!
