An ambulance is coming. A driver, a doctor, a nurse and an intern. Suddenly, the driver grabs his throat with both hands, his face turned red, and he wheezed... The nurse hit him with all her might on the head with a bag with an instrument, he was suffocating. They're moving on... Absolutely the same thing happens to a doctor... The nurse also hit him in the head with a bag. And the doctor's attack has passed... The intern is very interested in what is happening, and he says:
- I didn't know that hitting the head with a bag relieves suffocation.
The doctor responds:
- Yes, there is no suffocation, it's just that the nurse's husband hanged himself the day before yesterday... We're fucking up %!
