In the evening, the parents are going to the theater. A five-year-old son remains at home alone. Before leaving, the parents instruct their son:
- Do not open the door to anyone, my mother and I have the keys. Understood?
Son:
- Yeah, I get it!
The parents came out of the apartment and decided to check it out. They come to the door of their apartment and knock...
The son asks:
- Who's there?
Father:
- Gorgaz, open up, check the system.
The son is outside the door:
- Let's go to x%y, we're burning firewood!
