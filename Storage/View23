A man came up to the store, a girl came up to him and said:
- Uncle, hold the puppy, please, they won't let me into the store with him.
The man took the puppy, waited 15 minutes, waited 25 minutes, the girl did not come out, he could not stand it, went into the store and turned to the seller:
- Have you seen a girl here?
The seller:
- Most likely she will not come anymore. It was the fifth puppy, he's the last!
