A guy is in a cafe and looks at a beautiful girl at the table opposite. He decided, came up and asked:
- Girl, can I sit at your table?
The girl screams at all the cafes:
- Insolent, I won't sleep with you!
People turn around and smile. The guy blushed and returned to his table. The same girl sits down next to him and says:
- Excuse me, I'm a psychologist and I'm writing a dissertation on the topic "Behavior of people in inappropriate situations."
The guy suddenly, loudly at the whole cafe:
- How much? Two hundred bucks?
The girl ran out into the street, embarrassed. The guy got ready, followed her out and came up to her and said:
- It's very nice to meet you, I'm a lawyer and I know how to make a person feel guilty...
