At the boat station, the caretaker shouts on the intercom:
- Boat number 99, what's the matter with you?
Silence. He's back again:
- I repeat! Boat number 99 are you all right?
Someone is shouting:
- Yes, we don't have a boat, there are only 70 boats here!
By selector:
- Boat number 66 did something happen to you?
