The husband wakes up and wanders into the kitchen. In the kitchen, my wife is standing in front of the stove, on which there is a saucepan with eggs. Husband:
- What's with our breakfast?
Wife:
- Darling, fuck me right here and right now!
The husband, stunned by the unexpected offer, gladly decorated his wife right on the kitchen table. Then, catching his breath, he asks:
- What kind of whim is this all of a sudden?
Wife:
- Yes, the timer for cooking eggs is broken.
