My grandfather and grandmother came to the airfield. We decided to take a ride on the plane. Grandfather began to negotiate with the pilot. He agreed, but on condition that if the grandfather screamed in fear, he would pay $ 100. My grandfather agreed. We flew. The pilot started doing all sorts of tricks in the air and a dead loop, a roll on one wing, a sharp drop down and all that, but the old man did not make a sound. After landing, the pilot asks the old man:
- Well, what about Grandpa? Was there a moment when you almost screamed?
Grandfather:
- Yes, I was.
Pilot:
- What kind of aerobatics is it?
Grandfather:
- When my old woman fell out!
