A survey is being conducted among students from different countries who can learn Japanese in how much time. The first one was asked by an American. He surfed the Internet and said that he would master Japanese in two years:
The Frenchman was asked the second. He ran to the library, looked through the textbooks there, called the tutor and said that he was ready to learn in just a year.
The next on the list was a Russian student. They found him in the smoking room with a hangover, asked a question. Student:
- Do you have a manual?
They gave him a manual, he quickly flipped through it:
- I'll finish my smoke, I'll swallow a beer and I'm ready to take it.
