A man went out into the yard on a winter morning to warm up his lada, but it wouldn't start. I walked around the car, kicked the wheel, wiped the headlight - it won't start. I called a friend to help. A friend asks:
- Is there a secret?
The man answers:
- No!
A friend adjusted the carburetor, starts it up. It won't start. He's back with his question:
- Maybe there is some kind of secret?
The man replied again:
- No!
A friend has set up the ignition, starts it up. It won't start. Says:
- I don't understand... Are you sure there's a secret?
The man in response:
- What the fuck are you doing to me? I have a secret! I'm sleeping with my mother-in-law! What does this have to do with the car?
