The man wanted to buy an iPhone. For three months, I put my pay in the stash, denied myself food, entertainment, everything. I have finally saved up and realized my dream. I put my phone in my back pocket and forgot. I came home and sat down on a chair, there was a sharp crunch. A man with cold sweat on his forehead:
- Damn, if only the spine!
