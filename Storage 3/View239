The girl went to a bachelorette party and promised her husband that she would be like a bayonet at twelve. The company was cheerful and the time flew by unnoticed. Arriving home drunk in the trash, she quietly opened the front door and the cuckoo in the wall clock crowed exactly 4 times. Undeterred, she crowed 8 more times with the voice of a cuckoo and, thinking that everything had rolled, went to bed. The next day, her husband had breakfast at what time she returned. Answering him in an unperturbed voice that when she came in, the cuckoo crowed 12 times. To which the husband replied:
- I heard, but I think we need to change this cuckoo.
The girl was interested:
- Yes? And why?
The husband continued:
- Because when you came back, she crowed 4 times. Then she said Fuck. She crowed 4 more times, then blew her nose, crowed 2 more times, giggled maliciously and crowed the remaining 2 times, stepped on the cat and %bent over the parquet.
