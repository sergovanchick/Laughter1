Ilya Muromets is riding through the forest on a Vladimir heavy truck, in chain mail, with a club tucked under his belt, and D'Artagnan is on his horse to meet him. The path is narrow, there is no way to separate. Muromets says:
- He got off the path quickly!
D'Artagnan:
- Kanalia... Are you an oborzel bogatyr? I serve the queen, you can't talk to me like that, I fell off the path myself!
Muromets:
- Yes, I don't care who you serve there, let me pass. Damn!
D'Artagnan takes off his glove, throws it at the Murom man:
- A duel!
They walked off the path into the forest... After a couple of minutes, Ilyusha comes out of the forest, tucks the club under his belt, grunts:
- The young people were completely fucked up, they almost poked their eyes out with a wire.
