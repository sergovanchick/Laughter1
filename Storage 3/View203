A young married couple, expecting the addition of a family, came to consult a doctor. Husband:
- Doctor, what about sex during pregnancy?
Doctor:
- During the first third of the term, no problems, in the second third, only in the dog position, and in the third in the wolf position.
Husband:
- How is it in the wolf room?
Doctor:
- You lie near the hole and howl.
