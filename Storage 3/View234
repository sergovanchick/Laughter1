Two friends meet. The first one says:
- Think about it, yesterday, for fun, I advertised in the newspaper that there would be a gathering of mud @cov in the central square of the city at noon.
The second one is smiling:
- Probably figs who came?
The first one:
- On the contrary. The whole square was packed!
The second:
- Come on!
The first:
- So everyone came to see those who would come!
