The teacher instructed the student to write 100 times, "I will never tell the teacher again, you." He checks the notebook, and the student wrote this sentence not 100, but 200 times. The teacher asks:
- I gave you the task to write a proposal 100, not 200 times. Why did you write more?
Student:
- To make it more pleasant for you!
