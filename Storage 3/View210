Two guys are sitting in the cinema and waiting for the movie to start. Here a healthy bald man sits down in front of them. One guy, smiling maliciously, says to the other:
"Let's bet you half a ton that you can't slap him on the bald spot!"
The second one, after thinking about it, agreed to the dispute. We argued. The guy immediately slaps the bald man on the head. He's dead, he looks around a little, and the guy immediately:
- Lech is great! How many years, how many winters. Where has he disappeared?
Bald, blushed and says:
- What the fuck am I to you? Did you get confused?
The bald man turned away. A few minutes pass, and the first guy is back:
- Is it weak for the second round? For a hundred!
We argued. The same situation, the bald man turns angrily, about to chop the guy, and he:
- Lech, what are you kidding? How not native! You've shaved and you don't recognize your friends?
The bald, angry man gets up and goes to the front rows so that these jerks don't bother him. A few minutes later, an offer is received for the third visit, already for five dollars. We argued. The guy goes to the bald man, without hesitation slaps his bald head and shouts:
- Lech ept, that's where you're sitting! And I've been there for half an hour fucking another one!
