Soviet times...
The man took the coupons and went to get vodka. He stood in line, bought vodka, went outside, and there was a bully. The bully says to the man:
- Come here. I gave away the vodka!
I took the vodka from the guy... The man went home, took coupons from his wife, came back to the store, stood in line and went outside, and there again the same bully. And again the bully to the man:
- Come here. I gave away the vodka!
He took the vodka from the man again... The guy thinks that this is such a day. I went and borrowed coupons from a friend, came back to the store, stood in line just before the store closed, bought vodka and told the saleswoman:
- Let me out through the service exit, otherwise there's a bully on the street, he took away my vodka twice.
The saleswoman let the man out through the office, he came home happy, rolled 200 grams, lit a cigarette, leaned back in his chair and said:
- Come here, come here... Fuck you!
