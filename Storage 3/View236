The man tells:
- At weddings, I always dance first with the bride. So yesterday at the wedding I danced with the bride the first dance, the second, the third... Suddenly, the groom runs away and hits the bride between the legs.
Listeners:
- And what, did the bride die of pain?
Man:
- Yes, the bride would care, but this imp broke three fingers for me.
