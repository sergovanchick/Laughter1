A beggar knocks on the door, a man opens it for him. The beggar says:
- You are such a kind family. I already visited you a few hours ago. Your wife gave me a piece of her pie. Maybe you can help me now?
Guy:
- Did you give me your pie? How can I help you, I don't know? Only if you give me pills for my stomach.
