A cop is standing, braking cars. Stops the first one:
- Comrade driver, you are drunk.
Driver:
- No, I'm not drunk.
Cop:
- Then breathe into the balloon.
The driver breathed. The cop is surprised:
- The first degree of intoxication, a fine of 500 rubles.
The driver paid off and left. The cop slows down the next one:
- Comrade driver, you are drunk.
Driver:
- No, I'm not drunk.
Cop:
- Then breathe into the balloon.
Driver:
- What kind of balloon? It's a condom!
Cop:
- Hmm, really sober. Drive through.
