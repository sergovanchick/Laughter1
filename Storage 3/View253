American black kid asks mom:
- Mom, what is democracy?
She answers:
- This is when white people work every day so that we can get benefits, subsidies, free food, other benefits.
Son:
But Mom, aren't white people angry about this?
Mother:
- They're angry. Of course they are angry and this is called racism!
