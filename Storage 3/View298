One day, shortly after the wedding, the husband came home from work, and the wife told him:
- I've prepared a surprise for dinner tonight.
She put a large cake on the table and offered to taste it. The husband tried and thought about it. The wife asks:
- Did you like it?
The husband says:
- Tell me what kind of products you baked this cake from.
Wife:
- Why do you ask?
Husband:
- Because in the clinic I will have to answer the same question.
