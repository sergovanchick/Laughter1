A man calls the service "Wife for a minute":
- Yesterday I had Klava, can she come today?
They answer there:
- Yes, please, but all our girls are good.
Guy:
- Let Klava come. Everything was lying around well, everything was at hand. She cleaned up, I can't find anything, I just found my slippers. Socks, tie, I don't know where. The floor is so clean that I'm afraid to walk.
