A little daughter with her mother on the beach asks a question:
- Mom, why do the uncles have something in their trunks, but you don't?
Mother:
- Daughter, they hide wallets there.
Daughter:
- Mom, why do some have more and others have less?
Mother:
- It's just that some are richer, others are poorer.
Daughter:
- Mom, mom, look, the uncle is looking at you and getting richer!
