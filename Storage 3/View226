Wife to husband:
- You got drunk yesterday.
Husband:
- I feel there will be a scandal?
Wife:
- It won't be. I was there yesterday.
Husband:
- Really? In a nutshell, remind me.
Wife:
- I told you about alcohol consumption in rather harsh terms.
Husband:
- What am I doing?
Wife:
- You smoked, listened, and then you say that you are married for the second time, and judging by my measure of communication, it will not be the last.
Husband:
- What are you doing?
Wife:
- What am I doing? I shut up.
