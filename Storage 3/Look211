A remote village on the periphery. An expensive SUV drives into the village. A cool guy gets out of the car and an old lady goes to meet him. Cool says:
- Granny, do you remember, during the war she hid a little Jewish boy in a padded jacket from the Germans.
Granny:
- Of course I remember, darling.
Krutoy:
- So, I came for a padded jacket.
