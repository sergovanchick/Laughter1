A Jew and a Russian seminarian student are traveling on a train. The Jew asks:
- What kind of career will you have?
The student starts dreaming, telling:
- Well, if I finish well, I will enter the theological academy. Well, I'll become a priest, and if I finish well, maybe I'll get a higher post. Well, if everything goes well to the maximum, by the end of his life as a bishop. Of course, I do not exclude it if I try very, very hard, well, maybe I will become the Pope ...
a Jew:
- That's it?
Student:
- And who else? Not by God?!
A Jew after a pause:
- Well, one of our guys got out.
