Vovochka and dad come to the sports store, Vovochka saw the dumbbells and says:
- Dad, buy me dumbbells, I want to be like Schwarzenegger and I will practice every day.
The father looked at his son in disbelief, knocked out the check, handed it to the seller, and went to the car himself. Suddenly he hears his son's furious scream:
- Dad, where did you screw up? Did you really think I'd be the one to carry those damn dumbbells into the car?
