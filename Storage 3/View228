The husband, a military man, finds his wife with her lover, takes out a gun and says:
- Follow me.
They're leaving. The husband proposes to the lover:
- Let's find out once and for all who she needs. Let's do this. I'll shoot twice and we'll both fall. Whoever the wife runs up to first will stay with her.
The wife, hearing two shots, looks out the window, screams:
- Vanyusha, get out. These cretins shot each other!
