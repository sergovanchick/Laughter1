The addict decided to stock up on grass for the whole winter. The seller tells him:
- I will give you a big discount for such a batch, I give you a guarantee if the grass is not picky, I will return the money and pay a penalty.
I bought grass, came home, sat down in the kitchen, scored a joint, blew - does not insert. He sat, scored the second, blew, sat does not insert. Well, that you need to go for a guarantee. She's getting dressed. His mother asks him from the room:
- Where are you going?
An addict in response:
- On business!
The mother says:
- Awesome! I've been sitting in the kitchen all winter, and things have come up in the spring!
