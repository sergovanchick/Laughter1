The bear escaped from the zoo, the administration informed the city, but so far it cannot be found. Finally, Grandma calls:
- You're coming! A bear got into my yard and climbed a tree! Take it away, I'm really scared!
Five minutes later, a man arrives with a small dog, gives grandma a gun, points at the dog and says:
- Grandma, this is Kefir. Let's do this. I'm going to climb a tree, shake a branch, the bear will fall off, Kefirchik will grab him by the balls and drag him to the zoo.
Granny twirls the gun:
- OK. But why do I need a gun?
Guy:
- But if I suddenly fall down instead of a bear, shoot Kefirchik!
