A man is crawling in the desert, he wants to drink terribly. He repeats:
- God, I'm thirsty. How thirsty I am.
Then a shovel falls from the sky, a voice says:
- Dig!
The man took a shovel and a minute later dug out a jug of cold water, got drunk, and his voice:
- Put the shovel back!
The man threw a shovel into the sky and went on. It's coming, I'm hungry. Just thinking about it, a shovel is falling from the sky:
- Dig!
The man took a shovel and two minutes later dug out a chest with food. I ate to the brim, and a voice from the sky:
- Return the shovel!
The man threw a shovel, goes on and thinks:
- Now I'd like to fuck you for a complete set.
I just thought, a shoulder blade is falling from the sky and, as usual, a voice:
- Dig!
The man took a shovel, digs for a minute, an hour, three hours. Five hours later, he dug a huge hole, sat down at the bottom and said:
- Wow, I'm fucking crazy!
A voice from the sky:
- Bring back the shovel!
