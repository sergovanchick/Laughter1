A man slept with a girl. The next morning, the girl says:
- Of course, everything is fine, but today I have to go to the gynecologist with my mother for a virginity test.
The man opened a beer bottle, pulled an elastic band out of the cork, put it where it should be and assured that everything would be fine.
The girl and her mother went to the doctor. The girl sat down in an armchair, spread her legs, the doctor looked and fucked up. The mother asked excitedly:
- Doctor, is my daughter not a virgin?
Doctor:
- A virgin, then a virgin! But I've never seen an expiration date listed there...
