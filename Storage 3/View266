Drilling in Africa. The driller is standing on the brake drilling, and a monkey is sitting on a branch next to him and watching him closely. One day the driller left, returned, and the monkey was already standing on the brake instead of him and drilling, exactly repeating the production process. And so it is every time. The boss looked at it for a couple of weeks and fired the driller. Six months later, they call the driller from the drilling rig and say:
- Mikhalych, come back to us. We need a driller.
Mikhalych:
- So you have a monkey working instead of me.
They answer him:
- The monkey has become a master for the second week and we need a driller again.
