Four men are sitting playing preference. The son of the landlord rushes around the table, looks at the cards, yells. The man at the purchase tells the landlord:
- Can I talk to your child? You know, noise is the enemy of preference.
The owner doesn't mind. After five minutes, the player returns. The child is not heard, not seen. An hour later, the owner became worried and was interested:
- What did you say to him?
That:
- Especially nothing. He taught me how to jerk off.
