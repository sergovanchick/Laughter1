Two elderly residents of Odessa are sitting in a cafe on Deribasovskaya Street, looking at idly staggering tourists:
- Sema, look at how these women dress! This is not a beach, this is the city center! What kind of fashion is this, I'm asking you now? Yes, in the old days, women did not dress like that.
He answers:
- Yasha, I'll tell you more. In the old days, women in striptease never undressed.
