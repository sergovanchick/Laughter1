An experienced boxer tells a beginner a story from life...
- I come home earlier than I planned, oops, but my wife has a lover. I'll give him a hop-hop two without further ado - I'm ready!
The beginner says:
- A similar story. I come home, my wife has a lover. I didn't knock him down with a two, and I didn't put a three on him again. I concentrated. Again, a sharp two. Well, I can't knock you out and that's it...
- But I feel like I'm winning on points.
