He grabbed his husband, tied him to a chair, tied his wife to the bed, climbed on top of her, kissed her neck and hurried into the bathroom. he ties his wife to the bed, climbs on top of her, kisses her on the neck and goes to the bathroom. While the fugitive is not there, the husband tells his wife:
- Listen, this is the escaped prisoner who spent many years in prison and escaped. He hasn't seen a woman in years, I saw him kiss you on the neck. If he wants you, compromise, please him. It's not clear what's in his head. He can kill us. Be strong, darling. I love you!
The wife listened:
- He didn't kiss my neck, he whispered in my ear that during the many years he spent in prison he began to like men and that you are very sexy. He asked me where the vaseline was, I said it was in the bathroom. So be strong, dear. I love you!
