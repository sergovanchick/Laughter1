A fire in the hospital. Firefighters have put out everything and are approaching the chief physician:
- There are victims. There were three people in the basement. We pumped out two of them, but we couldn't get one.
The head doctor's legs gave way, he loses consciousness. He was brought to his senses and he turns to the firefighters:
- Guys, we actually have a morgue in the basement.
