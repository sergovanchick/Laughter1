Two friends are talking. First:
- At the party, I whispered to my boyfriend, as if hinting that I forgot to put on my panties. I read that it turns guys on.
The second:
- Well, how is it? Did it work?
First:
- Did it work? He said that I am completely! You can forget your keys, phone at home... But how can you forget to put on your underpants when leaving home?
