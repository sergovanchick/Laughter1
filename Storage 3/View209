One day, the Head, Hands and Ass decided to choose a boss. The head says:
- I should be the boss. I have a brain. I can think.
The hands are talking:
- We'll be the boss. We can do different things.
The ass also said:
- How about I be the boss?
Then everyone laughed at her. Well, what an Asshole boss. The ass didn't argue, got offended and shut up. And the next day, it was all fucked up. My head hurts, my arms don't lift. And they agreed to make the Ass their boss.
It's just like in life... You don't have to be with your head and hands. Any Asshole can become a boss.
