In Soviet times, a factory worker was sent to Moscow to join the Communist Party. At the admissions committee, the chairman asks him:
- Tell the commission about the decisions of the last congress of the CPSU.
The worker says:
- I don't know.
The Chairman told him:
- All right... Tell us about the leading role of the CPSU in the Soviet Union.
The worker again:
- I don't know.
Chairman:
- Dear candidate, here you have come to join the party, and not what you don't know!
- Do you actually know what the CPSU is?
The worker says:
- No, I don't know.
The Chairman clarifies:
- Where did you come from anyway?
A worker in response:
- From Kryzhopol.
The chairman sits down at the table, holds his head in both hands and says:
- Fucking mouth, I would give up everything, go to Kryzhopol!
