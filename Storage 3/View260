At the disco, a guy to a girl:
- Are you dancing?
- I dance, I sing, I read poetry.
- What are you talking about?
- I weave, embroider and knit with knitting needles.
- Are you driving, or what?
- I drive moonshine, braga, sometimes oil.
- Well, you're a girl!
- I give it, I take it in my mouth and put it in my ass.
- What are you treating?
- Hemorrhoids, depression, sexual disorders.
- Are you being stupid?
- I blunt, sharpen, sharpen knives, scissors, refuel razors.
- I don't fucking understand...
- Fuck, what don't you understand? I want to get married, get married!
