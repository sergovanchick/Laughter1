Vovochka comes to school with three bumps on her forehead. The teacher asks:
- Vovochka, what happened to you?
He tells me:
- We went to bed yesterday. Dad asks, are you asleep, Vovka? I say no. I got a slap on the forehead. Half an hour later, Dad asks, are you asleep, Vovka? I'm talking about sleeping. Once more on the forehead! Half an hour later, Dad asks, are you asleep, Vovka? I'm silent. Dad says to Mom, let's go!
And I'm asking:
- Where to?
