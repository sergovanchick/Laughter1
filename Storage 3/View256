The wife of her husband left late in the evening for cigarettes. The husband reluctantly got dressed, went outside, went to the bar on the way, sat down at the counter. A girl sat down next to her, talked, went to her, had sex. Early in the morning, the man woke up with the idea that he had to answer to his wife. He tells the girl:
- Do you have chalk?
The girl gave him chalk, he smeared his hands with chalk and went home. The hysterical wife asks:
- Where were you all night?
Husband:
- You know, I went out, I see the bar is open. I went in and sat down at the counter. A girl sat down next to her, talked, went to her, had sex. I got up in the morning and went home.
The wife, making a snide face, says:
- Well, hands for inspection!
The man looks down and shows his hands.
Wife:
- The brute was playing billiards with his friends all night again!
