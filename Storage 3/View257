The geologist asks the shepherd:
- Tell me, how much wool do your sheep produce in the season?
Shepherd:
- Well, it depends on which ones. White or black?
Geologist:
- Black.
Shepherd:
- Black - 20 kilograms.
Geologist:
- And the whites?
Shepherd:
- And the white ones are 20 kilograms.
Geologist:
- Tell me, Father, how much food do they need per day?
Shepherd:
- So it depends on which one. Black or white?
Geologist:
- Well, black.
Shepherd:
- Black - 10 kilograms.
The geologist asks a question, anticipating the answer:
- And the whites?
Shepherd:
- And white - 10 kilograms.
The geologist freaked out:
- Well, you steamed the father! Why do you divide into white and black if everything is the same?
Shepherd:
- So the black ones are mine!
Geologist:
- Well, now it's clear. And the whites?
Shepherd:
- So are my whites!
