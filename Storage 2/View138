The philosophy of love...
if you love something... Give him his freedom.
If it comes back... It will be yours forever.
If it doesn't come back... So, it never belonged to you.
But...
if it just sits in your room, watches your TV, messes up your things, eats your food, talks on your phone, takes money from you and does not suspect at all that you gave it freedom a long time ago... So either you're married to this, or you gave birth to this.
