Two mathematicians in a restaurant argued about how well other people know mathematics. The first claimed that most of them did not know her, and the second that, although they did not know much, they did. When the first one went to the toilet, the second one called the blonde waitress and told her:
- When my colleague returns, I will ask you a question. Do not delve into the very essence of the issue. All you have to do is give the answer - a third of the x cube.
The waitress asked again:
- Is the third stingy?
The second mathematician:
- Yes, not the Third stingy, but the Third X Cube! Is that clear? That's all I'm asking you to do.
The waitress leaves, repeating to herself like a spell:
- The third is stingy, the Third is stingy...
the first mathematician returns here. The second one says:
- Let's ask our waitress what some simple integral is equal to.
The first one agrees with a laugh. The second one calls the waitress and asks:
- Excuse me, do you remember what the integral of x^2 in dx is?
The waitress immediately answers:
- A third of the x cube!
The first one was very surprised, and the second one laughed quite a lot. The waitress took a few steps away and turning around adds:
- Plus a constant!
