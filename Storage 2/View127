In the position, the ensign goes into the toilet and commands loudly:
- Booths, pay off in order!
There is a sound coming from the booths:
- First, second, third, fourth!
Prapor:
- So that's it. The first three clean the booths they are in until they shine, and the fourth one makes the other ten shine.
A voice from the fourth booth:
- That's right, Comrade Ensign! Your task is clear. Do it, since you did not recognize the voice of the commander of the unit!
