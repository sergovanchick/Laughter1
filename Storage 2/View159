Three hooligans break into the convent and say:
- Now we're taking turns godlessly wiping you all off!
One of the newly arrived nuns stands in front of everyone else and says:
"Take me, but please don't touch anyone else!"
The abbess is indignant.:
- Sister Mary, fear God, you don't have to be so selfish!
