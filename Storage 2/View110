The young Scot visited Paris. And one evening, walking along the Grand Boulevards, he saw a pretty woman with an umbrella. He asked:
- Mademoiselle, how would you feel if we spent the night with you?
Mademoiselle was indignant:
- What are you doing? I'm not a corrupt woman!
The Scotsman:
- Mademoiselle, no one is talking about clothes!
