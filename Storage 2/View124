A veterinarian, statistician and physicist were invited to come up with a way to guess the horse that will win the race for $100,000 within a week. A week later, all three come. Veterinarian:
- I have developed a table according to which, knowing the physical characteristics of the horses, it will be possible to predict the winner.
Commission:
- Very useful information...
statistics:
- I have built a regression according to which, analyzing previous races, it is possible to predict the winner.
Commission:
- Very useful information!
Physicist:
- I need two more years and $1 million to work, but by now I have built a model for winning a spherical horse in a vacuum.
