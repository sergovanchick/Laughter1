In the silence of the night:
- Vasya, what time is it?
- Four.
Some time passes.
- Vasya, what time is it?
- Five.
After some more time.
- Vasya, what time is it?
- Six.
In another hour.
- How much is it?..
- Kolyan, get off with your stupid questions! That's what the fuck difference does it make to you? We went to prison for life.
