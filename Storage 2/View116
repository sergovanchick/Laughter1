- Nikolai, are you busy right now? Oh, No? Well, that's nice! Come to us, we are reading Brodsky here! Alexey brought four volumes of collected works. We have two graduate students from the Faculty of Philology of Moscow State University and a student from the Conservatory with us. If it's not difficult, bring some kind of musical instrument with you, for example a violin, or better yet a cello.
- Gray, where do you find such people? What is a cello? A liter of vodka?
- Yes, yes, Nikolai, we are waiting for you!
