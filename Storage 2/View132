A man is transporting a parrot on an airplane. Parrot to the flight attendant:
- Hey, whore, whiskey for me and at a pace!
The stewardess brought the parrot a whiskey. After a while, the parrot is back:
- Hey, maramoyka, whiskey for me and at a pace!
The stewardess brought whiskey to the parrot again. The man thought:
- Some parrot can rock, but I can't?
Shouts after the stewardess:
- Hey, with %chka, give me a beer quickly!
The stewardess couldn't stand it and reported to the commander. The commander decided to throw both the parrot and the man out of the plane. They dragged them to an open door and a parrot to a man:
- You're a man for not flying, you're too %bisty!
