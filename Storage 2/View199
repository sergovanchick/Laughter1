Granny comes to the tax office, brought some pension documents. The tax inspector accepted the piece of paper, checked it and says that there is not enough signature.
Granny:
- And how should I subscribe?
The tax inspector:
- Well, as usual, you sign ...
the grandmother signed and submits the document to the inspector. She looks at the signature, and there:
- I love you, I kiss you, Baba Nyura!
