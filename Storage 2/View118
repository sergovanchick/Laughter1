- Come on, fat, stop!
The boars stopped in shock. Hare:
- Lard, is there a problem?
The boars are shaking their heads, no. Hare:
- Fat, get the fuck out!
The boars are leaving. The next day, history repeats itself. The boars are tired of this, send the wolf to sort it out. The next day, a herd of wild boars runs through the forest with a wolf. Suddenly, the hare comes out again and says:
- Fat, stop!
The boars stop. Hare:
- Lard, is there a problem?
A wolf comes out of the herd:
- I'm your problem.
A hare in the bushes. He climbs out of the bushes with a drunken bear and says:
- Fat, fuck the moose, the problem remains!
