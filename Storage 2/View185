The husband comes into the bedroom and sees his wife gathering her things and carefully putting them in a large suitcase. The husband is surprised to be interested:
- Honey, what's wrong? What are you doing?
The wife does not stop packing things in a suitcase:
- I'm moving to Ohio. I heard that prostitutes there get $500 for what I do for you for free!
Later, when the wife was about to leave, she went into the bedroom and saw that her husband was also packing his things into a suitcase. Wife:
- Darling, where are you going?
Husband:
- I'm with you. I want to see how you live on $1,000 for a year.
