Baba Yaga gives his beautiful daughter in marriage and tells her:
- My daughter! I'll bring you a Pole, a German and a Russian in turn, and you choose.
She brought a Pole on a mortar and flew away. In the morning he arrives, his daughter stands on the porch and says smiling:
- Mom! I'm marrying a Pole! He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he beat me up three times during the night!
Baba Yaga to her:
- Wait, daughter. There are two more candidates!
I brought a German. In the morning she arrives, her daughter is beaming with happiness on the porch:
- Mom! I'm marrying a German! He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he fried me ten times a night, I thought I'd die of orgasm...
Baba Yaga:
- Wait, my daughter, another groom is on the way.
I brought a Russian, flew away. In the morning he arrives, the forest is felled, the owl has eyes on the tree for five kopecks, the hut is on one side, the daughter does not meet. Yaga came into the house, and her daughter was lying on a broken bed and wheezing in ecstasy:
- Mother, I'm marrying a Russian! I don't care that he's thumping and running like a steam locomotive... During the night, I was killed thirty times, an owl three times and once a cancer hut, and then went into the forest to clean up.
