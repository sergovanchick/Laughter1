Two men are talking. The first one:
- Yesterday, what did you bring into the house in a big box?
The second:
- I took the washing machine! She washes, wrings, dries, so noiseless!
The first:
- I'm better. She pours the water herself, puts the powder to sleep, washes, dries, puts it in an even pile. However, sometimes it makes a lot of noise.
Second:
- Does he even fold it? Imported?
The first one:
- What kind of people? Yes, it's domestic!
