Robert de Niro, after 50 years of marriage, once looked closely at his wife and said:
- Fifty years ago we had a very small house, an old one. It was a scary car, we slept on a leaky couch and watched a small black-and-white TV, but at that time, every night I went to bed with a very beautiful nineteen-year-old girl.
- Now I have a huge, luxurious house, a whole fleet of expensive cars, a huge bed in a luxurious bedroom, a color TV with a huge screen, but now I'm sleeping in the same bed with a sixty-year-old woman and I'm starting to doubt my marriage.
- My wife is a very sensible woman. Having learned my opinion on this matter, she was not offended and did not swear. She suggested that I find myself a nineteen-year-old girl, and in due time she would make sure that I lived in a small house again, slept on a sagging sofa and watched an old black-and-white TV.
