A new Russian came to buy a car one day. He walks into a car dealership, a salesman comes up to him and asks if he can help him in any way. What does the new Russian answer:
- I need a car, bro.
The seller told him:
- I recommend it, Ford Focus.
Nouveau Riche:
- And what's the trick?
The seller:
- You sit down, I'll show you now.
The seller accelerates to 200 km/h and rushes straight into a tree and asks:
- Do you see the tree?
Nouveau Riche:
- Well, I kind of see it.
The seller:
- Close your eyes, we're going to drive through it now. Just don't open your eyes!
The new Russian closes his eyes, the seller calmly drives around the tree and says:
- That's the trick!
The new Russian, surprised by such tricks of technology, of course buys a Ford Focus. On the same day, he collects a car full of homies and says:
- Now I'm going to show you a trick.
Accelerates to 200 km/h, directs the car at a hefty tree and says:
- Close your eyes. We're going to go through the tree now. But don't open your eyes!
They fly into a tree with all their dope, the car is in scrap, everything is broken, the nouveau riche himself barely gets out alive and moans:
- What bitch opened her eyes?
