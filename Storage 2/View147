There are three people in prison â€“ an alcoholic, a homosexual and a drug addict. They are thinking how to escape.
An alcoholic:
- Let's get the guard drunk at zero and get out of here.
Homosexual:
Are you crazy? Have you seen how healthy he is? Where can I get so much vodka? Can I seduce him?
The addict:
- Yes, such a man has at least ten women in his close circle! He won't fall for you. Let's get stoned and ask for a good time.
