The Jew, having reached home by taxi, gets out of the car in silence, starting to fumble in his pockets, mutters:
- I did drop my wallet in the car.
Upon hearing this, the taxi driver steps on the gas and runs away.
The Jew, looking after the taxi, says sarcastically:
- Oh, you didn't deceive Abrasha, the scheme works...
