- Holy Father, I want to confess my sin to you.
- I'm listening to you, my son.
- Yesterday I was walking in the park, and in the alley I saw a naked woman lying under a tree.
"That's not a sin, my son.
- I went closer to her and looked at her.
- This is also not a sin, but it is already a temptation.
- Then she spread her legs and looked at me playfully.
- This is already a strong temptation.
- And I stood rooted to the spot and stared at her until she left.
"My son, that's a terrible sin! It was a terrible sin not to use it!
