Three men are filing for divorce in court. The first one explains:
- You see, I am sexually dissatisfied. When my wife and I have sex, she rocks so hard that I get seasick and I can't reach orgasm.
Judge:
- The reason is clear, since this is the case, we will divorce.
The second one speaks out:
- I also have dissatisfaction with having sex with my wife. When we have sex, my wife sweats so profusely that I slip off her and can't come in any way.
Judge:
- This is, of course, a good reason, we will divorce.
The judge turns to the third:
- Well, are you also dissatisfied?
The third guy says:
- Not at all, I'm doing much better than that.
Judge:
- Why are you getting a divorce?
He answers:
- It's just that my wife has an intimate place, red.
Judge:
- So what?
Guy:
- There's nothing like that, just friends laughing!
