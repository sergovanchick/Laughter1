A guy, a friend and a girl are sitting, drinking tea, talking. The girl notices that she has run out of cookies and goes to the kitchen. From the kitchen, she hears her boyfriend talking to a friend. Friend:
- How is she?
The girl's boyfriend:
- Sucks so hard that your hair straightens up!
The girl heard this, ran into the room, slapped the guy and said:
- Are you fucking telling me this?
Guy:
- You're a fucking fool! I was telling you about the new extractor hood in the kitchen!
