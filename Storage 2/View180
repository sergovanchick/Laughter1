A mother advises her immaculate daughter before the wedding night:
- Listen, daughter, if you want to remember this night for the rest of your life, treat your husband to ten oysters before this case.
The next day, her mother, worried about her daughter's displeasure, asks her:
"What happened, did you not feed your husband with oysters?"
Daughter:
- Yes, I fed him. I ate all ten of them. But only four of them worked!
