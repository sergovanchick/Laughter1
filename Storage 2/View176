In the hospital corridor, a woman stops a passing doctor:
- Doctor, tell me, how is my husband?
The doctor answers:
- The operation was successful, but your husband will spend two more weeks in intensive care, then we will transfer him to a ward for serious patients. You yourself will have to take care of him for a couple of months, feed him, watch over him at night, take the duck out from under him, etc.
The wife begins to change her face, and the doctor continues:
- After discharge, you need to undergo rehabilitation. We will place him in an excellent sanatorium, but I must warn you right away, it is very expensive. Rehabilitation in a sanatorium costs money! And only after that, you will take him home, but he will no longer walk, and indeed move.
Having brought the woman to a mild coma, the doctor patted her on the shoulder with a smile:
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding. He died, he died.
