The wife is on trial:
- Your Honor, I ask you to separate us. My husband sold all the kitchen utensils and drank all the money!
Husband:
- Your Honor, I also demand a divorce! It was only a couple of weeks later that my wife noticed that there were no dishes in the kitchen! The mistress of the ept!
