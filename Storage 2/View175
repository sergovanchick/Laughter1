A man tied to a tree is yelling at the whole forest at the explosion:
- Help me! Save me! People!
A drunken forester appears out of nowhere:
- What the fuck are you shouting at the whole forest for?
Guy:
- Yes, the robbers tied me to a tree, I've been yelling for three hours and not a single x%y has come up.
The forester unbuttoning his pants:
- What a problem... Let's try again... Maybe mine will do?
