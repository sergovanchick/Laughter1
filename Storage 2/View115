A joint Russian-American crew was sent into space. The American looks out the window and says:
- What a thirst for knowledge the Russian people have after all. Flying over Russia, I see thousands of telescopes pointing at us.
The Russian scratches the turnip and says:
- These are not telescopes, they are drinking from our throats.
