The guy approaches the blonde:
â€“ Oh, girl, what a wig you have, how it suits you, it's not even noticeable that it's not your hair!
The blonde is surprised:
- How did you guess? I chose this one on purpose so that everyone would think that it was my natural hair!
Guy:
- I was standing in line behind you at the bookstore and saw that you bought a textbook on quantum mechanics.
