Little Red Riding Hood was walking through the forest to her grandmother. Towards the Grey Wolf:
- Little Red Riding Hood, I'm going to eat you now.
Red hat:
- Don't eat me, Gray Wolf, better fuck me once.
The wolf thought about it and fucked Little Red Riding Hood. He gets up, lifts his pants and says,
"Well, now I'm going to eat you."
Red hat:
- Don't eat me, Gray Wolf. You better fuck me again while I'm on fire.
The wolf thought about it and fucked her a second time.
And so on many, many more times. And when the wolf was buried, the bear on his grave said: - So that I don't see this damn thing in a red hat in the forest anymore!
