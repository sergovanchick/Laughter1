Rush hour. The bus stop is packed to capacity. A little boy asked for something from a policeman, and he sent him with a foul language. Two old ladies stand up for the boy:
- Citizen policeman, is it possible to send a little boy so openly with obscenities...
Policeman:
- If you knew what he asked for... He wants me to fuck his dog.
The grannies ask again:
"Did he say why?"
Policeman:
- He wants to have a police dog!
