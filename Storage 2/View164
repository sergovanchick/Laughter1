A husband and wife and a girl are riding in the elevator. Suddenly, the girl turns around and slaps the man, emphasizing:
- What an impudent man, and even with his wife!
The elevator doors open, the girl runs out, and the man blushing and stammering looking at his wife:
- Well, Ira, honestly!
Wife:
- Come on, come on, calm down. I stroked it.
