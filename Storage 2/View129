- Darling, have you ever cheated on me?
- Yes, my love. Only three times.
- Well, when is it?
- Do you remember when you wanted to open your own business and none of the banks wanted to give a loan, and then suddenly the president of the bank himself agreed?
- Yes, I remember. Thank you, you helped us get rich. And when was the second time?
- Do you remember when you got seriously ill and no one wanted to operate on you, and then suddenly the Chief Physician himself operated on you?
- Yes, of course I remember. Thank you, you saved my life. But when was the third time?
- Do you remember that you were 65 votes short in the elections!
