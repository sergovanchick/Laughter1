Children's camp. After lights out, all the kids are on their phones. Who listens to music, who writes SMS messages. The Counselor comes in:
- So. Everyone gave me their phones and went to sleep!
He packed it in a bag and left. But before handing over the cell phone, each child set an alarm clock on it for 2, 3, 4, 5 o'clock in the morning. And so on until the ascent!
