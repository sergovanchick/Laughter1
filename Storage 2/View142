To the director of the circus in the office, a man comes in and says:
- I want to give your circus one illusion. I came up with it myself!
Circus Director:
- Carefully.
Guy:
- A huge chest of shit is being taken out to the circus arena. They hook him to a cable and, to the sound of a drum roll, they lift him under the very, very dome of the circus and drop him from there! The whole arena is in shit, the dome is in shit, all the spectators are also in shit from head to toe...
- And then, in the light of bright spotlights, I enter the arena, in a white tailcoat...
