At the ball, the Hussars huddled in a circle:
- Tell me, Rzhevsky, does that lady over there take it in her mouth?
- Undoubtedly!
- Lieutenant, and that one over there?
Even better!
"And this one in the pink dress?"
- Wait a minute, she's going to turn around and tell me... Yes, it does!
- But how did you know, she just showed up here today?!
- Well, how did you find out... There is a mouth, so it takes!
