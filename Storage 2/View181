One stove-maker was laying a stove for the professor. The stove maker noticed that the professor was constantly not getting enough sleep and asked him:
- You are constantly sleepy. Why work so much at night at your age?
Professor:
- It's not about work. My wife snores, so I don't get enough sleep.
The stove maker advises:
- Spread her legs when she snores and everything will be fine.
The next day, the stove-maker comes to finish the stove, the professor, who has slept well, asks to explain the reason. The stove maker answers:
- I will not say how it is scientifically, but in our opinion, according to the stove, you just increased her craving!
