At the bazaar, an Armenian sells pork. A man comes up:
- How much do you sell pork?
Armenian:
- Berry, Ah! Harushi pork, fresh, delicious! I bought five killagrams myself yesterday! Twenty rubles, Eh!
The man:
- And what did you feed?
Armenian:
- All this pork is the best! I fed bread, I fed butter, I fed caviar!
The man:
- You know, actually, I'm from the authorities, there's a crisis in the country, and you feed a pig with caviar and butter!
Armenian:
- Hey, listen, friend, five hundred pounds, ten kilos, don't put me down, let me trade!
The guy takes five kilos and leaves. Another guy comes up, asks about the price and continues:
- What did you feed me?
Armenian:
- Yes, I fed you with fuel oil, I fed you sawdust, I fed everything in the trash.
Man:
- I'm actually from the sanitary inspection station!
Armenian:
- Slush dear, take the pork you want, don't close the point, let's trade!
The man takes the pork and leaves. A third man approaches:
- What did you feed me?
Armenian:
- I gave the pig money, he went to the canteen himself. I don't know what's going on there!
