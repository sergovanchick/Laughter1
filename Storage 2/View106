A guy comes home covered in blood and with a black eye. The father leaves the newspaper and runs up to his son.
.. Who's calling you that?
Guy:
- Yes, here in our alley, three attacked. They liked my phone...
Father:
- So, yeah. Can you identify them?"
- What the hell am I doing?
- They should be identified, close relatives should!
