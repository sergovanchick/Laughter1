The foreigner guy watched the cartoon "Holidays in Prostokvashino" with English subtitles. Immediately there are a lot of questions:
- Why is Uncle Fyodor an uncle? He's a boy!
- Why did he leave alone, it is not clear where his parents do not care?
- Why didn't they arrest the postman Pechkin?
- Why did Uncle Fyodor live in someone else's house, but he still received mail?
This guy, the cartoon Hedgehog in the fog, I don't think he needs to watch...
