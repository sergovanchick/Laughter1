Posachera, when you came from the corporate party, I undressed you, told you a lot of compliments, listened patiently to you, who told whom and what, what a fool this Nelly Stepanovna was, danced with you three times to your favorite Pulp Fiction song, gave you a massage a couple of times, opened champagne on your whim, laying you down I went to sleep, stroked your hair...
yesterday I came from the corporate party... Long debriefings, what's so late and what the fuck is the lipstick on my shirt, then a rag in my face and I'm a fucking drunk brute and I'm not going to not talk to you...
Well, where is it, equality?
