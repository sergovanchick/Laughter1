A man went to hang himself. The archangel comes down to him, asks:
- Man, why are you hanging yourself? Tell me, is it good to have a beer?
Guy:
- Good!
Archangel:
- Is it good to go fishing?
Guy:
- Of course it's good!
Archangel:
- Is it good to sit in the bathhouse?
Guy:
- Okay, but where's the point, what's the point?
ARCHANGEL:
- Oh, so you need a sense! Go hang yourself!
