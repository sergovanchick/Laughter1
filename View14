Rainy day. On a country road, the general goes to the unit and sees a stuck truck from his unit. I decided to help. They started pushing the truck with the driver. They smeared themselves in the mud, but the truck was still pushed out. The general, wiping his sweat and shaking hands with the truck driver, says:
"It's a heavy truck, though.
The driver answers:
- Of course it's heavy, I have a whole company of demob in the back going home...
