Americans and Azerbaijanis argued over who has the longest elderly. Azerbaijanis came to America and in the old district, a 103-year-old man was found in the hospital under a drip in the intensive care unit...
The Americans went to Azerbaijan. They see an old man coming down the mountain at great speed. The Americans stop him and ask how old he is. He answers:
- 102.
The Americans are happy, they say they won. And then one of them is interested:
- And where are you in such a hurry?
The old man answers:
- I'm running away from my father.
The Americans look at each other and ask:
- And why?
The old man answers:
- I was rude to my grandfather.
