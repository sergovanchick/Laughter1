The only son of a rich, sickly father, began to plan for the future after his father died.
I decided it was time to get married, the household would be big. At a meeting of shareholders, he was stunned by a beautiful girl and approached her:
- Lady, you probably think I'm a simple guy, but I'm the future heir to $100 million. The girl took his business card with interest. A week later, she became his stepmother.
