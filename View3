- Give me the diary!
And my son has a deuce in his diary. He comes up to Mom and says:
- Mom, Dad came home from work, angry, asks me for a diary, and I have a deuce in my diary.
Mom takes the diary, puts three rubles in it and gives it to her son. The son brings the diary to his father, who opens it and says:
